|**PreAttack**|PreAttack could be either an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan the target system and identify an entry point. </br>Further details on the PreAttack stage can be read in [MITRE's page](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/pre/).||**InitialAccess**|InitialAccess is the stage where an attacker manages to get a foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Threat actors will often be able to control the resource after this stage.|
